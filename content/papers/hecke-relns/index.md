##### Abstract

We derive identities from Hecke operators acting on a family of Eisenstein-eta quotients, yielding congruences for their coefficients modulo powers of primes. As an application we derive systematic congruences for several higher-order smallest parts functions modulo prime powers, resolving a question of Garvan for these cases. We also relate moments of cranks and ranks to the partition function modulo prime powers. Some of our results strengthen and generalize those of a 2023 paper by Wang and Yang.
