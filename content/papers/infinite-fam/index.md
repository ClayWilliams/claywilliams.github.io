##### Abstract

We exhibit an infinite family of vector-valued mock theta functions indexed by positive integers coprime to 6. These are built from specializations of Dysonâ€™s rank generating function and related functions studied by Watson, Gordon, and McIntosh. The associated completed harmonic Maass forms transform according to the Weil representation attached to a rank one lattice. This strengthens a 2010 result of Bringmann and Ono and a 2019 result of Garvan. See also the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08574). Work greatly improves the results from my (corrected) [MS thesis](content/papers/hecke-relns/msthesis.pdf).
